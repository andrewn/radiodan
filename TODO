Add some goddamn tests, dammnit.

Create ruby daemon to manage MPD:
  ✓ Load Radio 4 playlist
  ✓ Start playing
  * Add listeners to check for end of songs / playlist
  * Play a different track in response to stimuli:
    - HTTP Request?
    ✓ A touched file?
    - After X Seconds?
    - Google Calendar Schedule
  ✓ Refactor ./bin/start into DI / Controller object
  * Show player status on webserver
  ✓ Refactor playlists into DB model
  * Refactor MPD into player/client
